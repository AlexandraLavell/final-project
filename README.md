## Project Name: 
Good morning
## Usage: 
Simple and customizable tool for managers of employees engaging in project based work. 
This application uploads basic employee and project information.
My goals for this project:
 Build an app using all the tools I learned in my Concordia intesive Full Stack Web Dev diploma and also integrate a novel
 use of these tools that was not part of the diploma. The two parts of this project that satisfy the second criteria, are the use of drag and drop to update state and use of recharts to render the graphs on the main dashboard.
Created in 2 weeks (everything except readme)
It allows a manager and/or employee quickly see:

* How much money has been allocated to all projects and how much is left
* Project status (complete, in progress, not started)
* Project approval (approved, pending approval)
* Project budget (requested budget, approved budget)
* Employees can be added to a project using a drag-and-drop employee card
* Projects can be added to an employee using a drag-and-drop project card
* Employees and projects can be added, modified and deleted
